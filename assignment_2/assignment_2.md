# Assignment 1

`example2_1.cpp` shows how you can use a for loop to print a row of stars, as many as the user wants. `example2_2.cpp` uses a nested loop to extend the line to a box. This assignment is adding a bit of complexity to `example2_2.cpp`

# Problem statement
Write a C++ program that prints a `n_row` by `n_col` rectangle made from stars. `n_row` and `n_col` are user inputs. Here is an example

    how many rows? 4
    how many cols? 5
