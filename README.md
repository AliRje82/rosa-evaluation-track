# What is ROSA evaluation track?
Interested students can freely join the track, where they'll be asked to do a number of assignments. By doing so, we can make sure they have the minimum necessary skills required in the project. Once the track is successfully done, students can apply for a position. 

# Assignments
There is a series of assignments, each covering a certain topic. For each, we provide examples and the assignment problem statement. Each assignment assumes you know the previous assignments and are comfortable with them. Please follow the order specified in [recommended_order.csv](recommended_order.csv).

We cannot provide any training. The example will help you a lot, but you'll have your own self-study to do. 

# How to submit assignments
The main branch of the repository always contains examples, templates and necessary files. There is a folder for each assignment. 

You'll get your personal branch `candidate/<your-name>/main`. This branch is protected, meaning that you can't directly push to it. For submitting an assignment, you must always create a branch `candidate/<your-name>/<desired-branch-name>`, push your changes and once ready, make a Merge Request (MR).

Once you submit an MR, reviewers will get back to you with comments if necessary. The assignment is passed once your MR is approved and merged into `candidate/<your-name>/main`.

# Requirements
There are certain rules about how you pass an assignment, how much time you have, etc. Here are the requirements:

1. You have 90 days to pass all assignments from the time you receive the invitation email to the repository.
2. You pass an assignment ONLY when the related Merge Request is approved.
3. Your coding style matters. Clean, readable, well-commented code is important.
4. You should be proactive and independent. Keep in mind that the problem statements of assignments might be incomplete or even wrong. 
5. Learning how to use Git and Github are among the goals of this track. So in addition to C++ or MATLAB assignments, good use of git matters as well.
