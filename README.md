# What is ROSA evaluation track?
Interested students can freely join the track, where they'll be asked to do a number of assignments. By doing so, we can make sure they have the minimum necessary skills required in the project. Once the track is successfully done, students can apply for a position. 

# Assignments
There is a series of assignments, each covering a certain topic. For each, we provide examples and the assignment problem statement. Each assignment assumes you know the previous assignments and are comfortable with them.

We cannot provide any training. The example will help you a lot, but you'll have your own self-study to do.

# How does it work?
The main branch of the repository always contains examples, templates and necessary files. There is a folder for each assignment. 

You'll get your personal branch "candidate/\<your-name\>/main". This branch is protected, meaning that you can't directly push to it. For submitting an assignment, you must always create a branch "candidate/\<your-name\>/\<desired-branch-name\>", push your changes and once ready, make a Merge Request (MR).

Once you submit an MR, reviewers will get back to you with comments if necessary. The assignment is passed once your MR is approved and merged into "candidate/\<your-name\>/main".
