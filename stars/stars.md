# Assignment

`example_1.cpp` shows how you can use a for loop to print a row of stars, as many as the user wants. `example_2.cpp` uses a nested loop to extend the line to a box. This assignment is adding a bit of complexity to `example_2.cpp`

# Problem statement
Write a C++ program that prints a `n_row` by `n_col` rectangle made from stars. `n_row` and `n_col` are user inputs. Here is an example

    how many rows? 4
    how many cols? 5
    *****
    *   *
    *   *
    *****

You must use `stars.cpp` as the file name and save it in this folder.
