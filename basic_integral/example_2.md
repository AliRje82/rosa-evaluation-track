Consider the quadratic equation
$$ax^2+bx+c = 0.$$
Let us remind ourselves of how the roots are calculated. You first calculate the discriminant 
$$d = b^2-4ac. $$

If $d>0$, the equation has two distinct and real roots given by
$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{d}}{2a}.$$

If $d=0$, the equation has a real root given by
$$x = \frac{-b}{2a}$$
(From a mathematical point of view, there are always two roots. If $d=0$, these two roots become equal.)

If $d<0$, the equation has two "imaginary" roots. I'm not sure if you've learnt complex numbers in highschool so let's skip the third case.
